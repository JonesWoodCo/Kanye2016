                        okay we know it's racist people, we know that a lot of white men over
                        the age of 60 are racist, we embrace that. We know that a lot of
                        people that are in power don't really... they're like Donald Sterling.
                        We understand that. We know that, but the world is moving. Ten years
                        from now, 20 years from now, every person of color or female or any
                        minority that comes into power will eventually shift it. You got the
                        ozone layer, you got all this stuff, you see 100 years from now the
                        entire world might be black. Just to even survive on the earth, period."

                        something that in definition I think is a really close thing to
                        love, and love is really close to God, and God is the master creator.
